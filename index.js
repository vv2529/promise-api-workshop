/*
 * Your task is to implement Promise static methods that already exist in the API (.resolve, .reject, .all, .race),
 * as well as a couple of new ones that are not yet implemented (.allSettled, .any) via a Promise constructor.
 *
 * Note that after you implement a method, it's allowed to use it in other methods.
 *
 * Methods behavior should match the TC39 specification, so pay attention to the requirements described in the comments.
 *
 * Some inputs specify an "iterable", but it's ok to account for arrays only.
 *
 * Be sure to validate inputs â€” throw a TypeError if the input is invalid!
 *
 * After you're done, check your implementation by running
 * `npm run test`
 * in the console.
 *
 * If you'd like to run tests separately for individual methods, try:
 * `jest __tests__/[nameOfTheMethod].js`
 *
 * For example, to run CustomPromise.resolve tests only:
 * * `jest __tests__/resolve.js`
